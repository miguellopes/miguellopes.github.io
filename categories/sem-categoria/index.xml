      <description>It has been about 2 years since my last update to this site, I have been invested in other projects but now I should be back to posting regularly. In the past this website served as playground to test my skills on a live server, pushing low server resources to the maximum and being able to compete against much more well equiped servers. Now I think I need a more presentable website, a place where I can redirect potential customers so they can learn more about me, and this is where we are.</description>
