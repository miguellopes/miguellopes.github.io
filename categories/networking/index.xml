      <description>At home I have about 5 computers which I have repurposed to serve a few virtual machines and a backup server as well as a VPN server to be able to connect back to access the services I have at home. This setup has been useful but as time goes by the old hardware starts failing, on summers the heat generated by the computers becomes uncomfortable as well as the cost of the electricity to keep everything running and cold.</description>
