      <description>Since I got admitted at FEUP (Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto) one of the biggest inconveniences was to find a place to park the car. Depending at what time the classes started it could be easy or almost impossible to park anywhere near the campus.
The student parking lot can only hold about 370 cars and at the beginning of this semester there was a big change. The parking space around the campus is now paid so the students can only park either on the campus parking lot or leave their cars far away from campus to avoid having to pay.</description>
