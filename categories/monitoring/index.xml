      <description>On march I moved my server and I had little time to do it I was handling 3 projects and all of them with a very tight schedule. On that transition I forgot to update the logrotate configuration. My http logs are on a directory that differs from the standard so they were left out of the rotation. A couple of days ago I went to check my logs and found an access log wich was about 62MB.</description>
