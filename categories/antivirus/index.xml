      <description>On a recent pentest I had as main objective to gain access into a database of a client which had a few websites running on their server. After a few hours of examining the server I had found a file upload form which would allow me to upload php scripts so I tried to send a php shell that I had written a few years ago.
Upon uploading the file it would get delete before I could execute it.</description>
