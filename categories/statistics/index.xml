      <description>As I wrote on a previous post I recently made an webapp that displays the number of currently available parking spots on the FEUP campus parking lot.
Since it&amp;rsquo;s conception it has been gathering data and now that I have about a week of data is time to prepare for the next stage which is make predictions on the availability of the parking lot. For that I have chosen linear regression.</description>
