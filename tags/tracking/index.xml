      <description>Recently I felt the need to use an old trick. I needed to know when an email has been seen without expressly asking the recipient to do so. Yesterday before sending an email I was considering possible outcomes and decided to resort to what is now called a tracking pixel. A tracking pixel is a technique that consists in creating a link that is inserted in a email as an image, the nice part is that we record the event so we know when it happened.</description>
